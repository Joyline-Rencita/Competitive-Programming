Problem Statement
In a lively car showroom, an array of cars awaits, each with its distinctive features. Picture yourself mixing and matching these cars in unique combinations to create dream blends which has a fscore equal to the
XOR value of the combination. Your mission: compute the blend score, which is the XOR of the fscore values for all these dreamy combinations.  Now, it's time to reveal the grand total!

Input Format
The first line of input consists of the integer n â€“ representing the number of cars in the showroom.

The second line consists of n integers - representing the features of the car. 

Output Format
Print the sum of fscore obtained.

Constraints
1 <= n<= 10^4
0 <= fi <= 10^4.

Sample Testcase 0
Testcase Input
5
4 3 5 1 2
Testcase Output
3
Explanation
The xor of all the combinations possible is:

4 ^ (4^3) ^ (4^3^5) ^ (4^3^5^1) ^ (4^3^5^1^2) ^ (3) ^ (3^5) ^ (3^5^1) ^ (3^5^1^2) ^ (5) ^ (5^1) ^ (5^1^2) ^ (1) ^ (1^2) ^ 2 = 3

Sample Testcase 1
Testcase Input
4
1 4 5 2
Testcase Output
0
Explanation
The xor of all the combinations possible is:
1 ^ (1^4) ^ (1^4^5) ^ (1^4^5^2) ^ (4) ^ (4^5) ^ (4^5^2) ^ (5) ^ (5^2) ^ 2 = 0

SOLUTION : 

class Solution {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        
        // Read number of cars
        int n = scanner.nextInt();
        int[] features = new int[n];
        
        // Read the features of the cars
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            features[i] = scanner.nextInt();
        }
        
        // Initialize result to 0
        int result = 0;
        
        // Iterate over all bit positions (assuming 0 <= fi <= 10000, hence 14 bits max)
        for (int bit = 0; bit < 14; bit++) {
            int count = 0;
            
            // Count the number of elements with the current bit set
            for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
                if ((features[i] & (1 << bit)) != 0) {
                    count++;
                }
            }
            
            // Each bit position contributes to the final result if its count is odd
            if (count % 2 != 0) {
                result |= (1 << bit);
            }
        }
        
        // Print the final result
        System.out.println(result);
    }
}
